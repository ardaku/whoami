## MSRV

MSRV is updated according to the [Ardaku MSRV guidelines], so it will only get
updated on minor and major version bumps.  All 2.x releases will be maintained
with bugfixes until the end of 2027 at minimum.

 - WhoAmI 2.2: Rust 1.85 MSRV (bump to get the 2024 edition, pull in nix, etc.)
 - WhoAmI 2.1: Rust 1.75 MSRV (bump for new lang features, faster CI, pull in
   libc, etc.)
 - WhoAmI 2.0: Rust 1.65 MSRV (support based on original 2.0 plan)
 - WhoAmI 1.x: Rust 1.40 MSRV (old MSRV policy, maintained until end of 2025 at
   minimum)

Target-Specific MSRVs:

 - When the `std` feature is disabled, WhoAmI bumps the MSRV to Rust 1.81 for
   the WhoAmI 2.0 and WhoAmI 2.1 release tracks.  This feature should usually
   stay enabled, unless you have a specific use-case targeting no-std.

## Binary

[whome] - `whoami` command RiR (Re-written in Rust) that depends on this crate.

## Testing

The interactive testing procedure is documented in the release PR template.  The
full manual test suite is run for each change that affects multiple platforms.
